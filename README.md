### App Description
Allows for students to pass on books and class notes after they’re done using them for the semester. Instead of dumping books into a collection of diferent books, they can be categorized based on the class and teacher it was used for. The UI for the app will make it more user friendly. For example, we will have a book used for Comp 200, which will go into the Comp 200 class.Then we’ll have a group of other classes for Comp Sci. with books in Comp 100, Comp 200, Comp 300. Those classes are under Computer Science, and Computer Science is under Engineering

### App Idea Evaluation

- Category: Education
- Mobile: It takes away the scenario of searching for ISBN numbers of books and not being able to find them. This app will have the opportunity to have inventory of requried books .
- Story: Allows users to share books and take away the stress of finding books for classes before assignments are given to them.
- Market: With the potential base, we will need to interact with Universities to know the courses they provide. In knowing the courses we can then containers of the classes allowing for users to populate classes with their books. So each user experince will be uniquely different from each school.
- Habit: This app is used throughout the semester.
- Scope: We will have a foundational layout, but the hiearchy of class categories will be different each school.
