## Favorite Existing Apps - Categorize and Evaluate

### Instagram
- **Category:** Photo & Video / Social / Entertainment
- **Mobile:** Product experience is primarily focused on mobile. App is mainly a view website to see and post pictures and videos.
- **Story:** App allows users to showcase their lives in an artsy way by editing and posting pictures.
- **Market:** App is primarily focused for younger generations, but anyone with a phone and a camera can use it. App also allows to filter through pictures through categories and hashtags.
- **Habit:** App is very addictive, since there is always new content constantly being posted in it. App is also very habit-forming through the "Instagram Stories" feature, which allows users to post pictures to showcase how their day is going. Average user will both consume (viewing and liking posts) AND create (posting) in this app 
- **Scope:** Instagram's features have been expanding over time, now adding a chat feature (Like Facebook Messenger), a Stories feature (like Snapchat), and InstagramTV (like YouTube).

### GroupMe
- **Category:** Social
- **Mobile:** It makes grouping communication with large groups easier with the friendly user-interface.
- **Story:** App lets users chat through wifi rather than over cellular data. You can create an account through your email address, Facebook account, or Microsoft account. GroupMe allows for users to create their own private or group chats.
- **Market:** With the set-up of this app it can be applied in different settings such as educational, social events, or in the workplace.
- **Habit:** This app can be used daily depending on the purpose of the groupchat.
- **Scope:** The features of this app continue to be built upon, but the app seems to be composed on different containers to hold different profiles with user's name, phone number, and email. The complexity with this app is signing into GroupMe with other applications such as Google or FaceBook.

### WhatsApp
- **Category:** Social
- **Mobile:** This app was initially mobile only until it became available as a desktop app. However, this app is unique because of its ability to sync user data linked to your phone number.
- **Story:** Users can communicate with anyone who also has the app. Allows them to send texts, photos, videos, files, location, music, and forwarded messages.
- **Market:** Anyone who has this app can communicate with one another. The user also needs an active phone number to recieve a confirmation text.
- **Habit:** Users might use WhatsApp as their primary communication platform if they have constant access to wifi/data. Due to its simile layout, ability to easily make groups, and forward messages/photos to multiple chats at the same time, WhatsApp is very habit-forming for communication.
- **Scope:** Since WhatsApp has now been acquired by FaceBook, which is no doubt the largest communication platform in the world, it has great scope to grow. 

### Netflix
- **Category:** Entertainment
- **Mobile:** Netflix started as a website but later became to be a mobile app offered in both iOS and Android devices. App is not limited by either one of these - it focuses on both website and mobile experiences.
- **Story:** Netflix allows users to watch movies and shows, organizing them into different categories. Content can also be viewed in different languages and with subtitles. It also allows for users to rate and review content for the general audience.
- **Market:** Netflix is not focused on a specific audience - anyone with a phone or a computer that wants to watch a show or movie that is offered in Netflix will benefit from it. 
- **Habit:** Netflix is a very addictive app since it allows users to binge watch shows without the need to wait for the next episode to come out, skipping the commercials. It is primarily a consumable app, since an average user (or the majority of users for the most part) will not be creating any content in it.
- **Scope:** Besides offering more new content and bettering the user experience and design, Netflix does not really have a lot of scope to grow.

### Starbucks
- **Category:** Food and Drink
- **Mobile:** Application is mobile only. Orders are executed through mobile while the web application contains packaged products which could be purchased.
- **Story:** Allows users to easily order coffee and food beforehand to save time and quickly pickup from physical stores.
- **Market:** Anyone who has access to Starbucks stores and a smartphone to download the app.
- **Habit:** Users usually use the app to recieve points which ultimately add up to free drinks/food. This creates a habit for users to make it a routine to order. Users also use it to skip the line in stores and quickly pickup their orders.
- **Scope:** Starbucks started with physical stores and made a mobile application which was extremely convenient and had a clean interface. This attracted their already existing customers as well as added new ones since users were basically able to demo the store products (menu) from the app.
